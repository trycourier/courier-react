### [Pinning](#pinning)

Pinning is a new feature as of 3.6.0 that allows you to "pin" certain messages to the top of their inbox. The pins are configured into `slots` by editing your brand in the [Courier Studio]("https://app.courier.com/brands) or by passing in a brand object with the correct pin slots. A pin slot is defined as:

```typescript
interface PinSlot {
  id: string;
  label: {
    value?: string;
    color?: string;
  };
  icon: {
    value?: string;
    color?: string;
  };
}
```

The default Pin looks like:

They can be configured to look like:

You can override the styling of the Pin through css accessing `theme?.message?.pinned` or by passing in a `renderPin(pinSlot)` as a property to the <Inbox> component.
