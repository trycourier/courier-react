## New Inbox Styling

We've released a new styling of Inbox (seen below). The new Inbox is streamlined and simplified and focuses on a single list of messages instead of the multi tabbed approach. There should be no changes required of you to utilize these new designs.

_Classic Theme:_

> To opt out of the new theme, pass `theme.name === 'classic'` as a property to you <Inbox /> component

Some of the main differences are the following:

1.  Single list of messages for all messages instead of "Unread/All Messages"
2.  Messages with one action block will now be clickable instead of rendering a button. There is a hover effect on the message to let the user know they can click on the entire message.
3.  Archiving is message is now available via the UI

## What is Inbox?

Inbox is a React component that you can add to your application and show a user a list of recent messages they have received. Each message supports the following events:

1. `Opened`
   When the Inbox is opened and a message is in view, we will fire off `opened` events. One event per message. We will not send > 1 opened per message.
2. `Read/Unread`

3. `Clicked`
   If a message has a click action associated with it, we will track clicks in the Courier Studio. The message will have a hover effect if the message is clickable as seen below.
