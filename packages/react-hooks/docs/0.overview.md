### [Overview](#overview)

`@trycourier/react-hooks` exist as a separate package so that you can build your own interface using our api and state management without having to install all the dependencies that `@trycourier/react-inbox` or other `react-dom` based packages include.

This also enables using this package with `react-native` in a much simpler way.
