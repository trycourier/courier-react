## [Overview](#overview)

`@trycourier/react-hooks` exist as a separate package so that you can build your own interface using our api and state management without having to install all the dependencies that `@trycourier/react-inbox` or other `react-dom` based packages include.

This also enables using this package with `react-native` in a much simpler way.

## [3.X Breaking Changes](#3x-breaking-changes)

As of 3.X we have started to use a new API for our inbox messages. The interface is slightly different which means interacting with the `useInbox` hook will need to be updated to match the new interface.

### Message Interface

```ts
interface ActionBlock {
  type: "text";
  text: string;
  url: string;
}

interface OldMessage {
  title: string;
  body: string;
  read?: boolean;
  blocks: Array<TextBlock | ActionBlock>;
}

interface ActionElement {
  type: "text";
  content: string;
  href: string;
}

interface NewMessage {
  title: string;
  preview: string;
  read?: string;
  actions: Array<ActionElement>;
}
```

This means if you were consuming `const { messages } = useInbox` that the array of messages will now be different and will need to be updated.

### Events

The old versions had events like `markRead(messageId, trackingId)`. The new version no longer requires passing a trackingId to track events.

- 1.X/2.X Old Interface:

```ts
interface IInboxActions {
  markMessageArchived: (
    messageId: string,
    trackingId?: string
  ) => Promise<void>;
  markMessageRead: (messageId: string, trackingId?: string) => Promise<void>;
  markMessageUnread: (messageId: string, trackingId?: string) => Promise<void>;
  markMessageOpened: (messageId: string, trackingId: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

- 3.X Interface:

```ts
interface IInboxActions {
  markMessageArchived: (messageId: string) => Promise<void>;
  markMessageRead: (messageId: string) => Promise<void>;
  markMessageUnread: (messageId: string) => Promise<void>;
  markMessageOpened: (messageId: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```
