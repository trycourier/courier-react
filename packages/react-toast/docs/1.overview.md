## [What is Toast?](#what-is-toast)

Toast aims to be the easiest way to create in-app notifications. With a simple integration and straightforward API, we make it easy for anyone to integrate fast.

Toast is a **buzzword** for a notification that happens in-app and slides in or pops up. The appearance is usually that of a rectangle in the top right of an application.

## [Features](#features)

- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup with Courier Provider
- **Flexible Positioning**: Multiple position options (top, bottom, left, right, center)
- **Customizable Theming**: Full control over appearance with styled-components
- **Auto-dismiss**: Configurable auto-close timing
- **Clickable Messages**: Support for clickable notifications with actions
- **Progress Bar**: Visual indicator for auto-dismiss timing
- **Accessibility**: Built-in ARIA roles and keyboard navigation
- **Custom Rendering**: Ability to render custom message components
- **Brand Integration**: Support for Courier brand styling

## [How does it work?](#how-does-it-work)

There are two ways to use this library:

1. **With Courier as a transport provider** - Receive notifications from your backend via Courier's API
2. **Standalone toast interface** - Trigger notifications directly from your React components

### Courier Push Integration

You can use the [Courier Push integration](https://app.courier.com/integrations/courier) to create a notification through the designer and send a notification to a specific channel/event from an API request. This will trigger the toast to show wherever the client is running and listening for that same channel/event.

A channel/event combination is simply a stream on which a particular client is listening for toast notifications. A client must be subscribed to a channel and event in order to receive a notification.

### Local Toast Triggers

For local notifications, you can use the `useToast` hook to trigger toasts directly from your React components without needing a backend integration.

## [Version 5.X CSP Migration](#version-5-migration)

We've released new subdomains to power Inbox and Toast. This migration only applies to Inbox and Toast users who applied our old URLs to their Content Security Policy.

## [3.X Breaking Changes](#3x-breaking-changes)

We've implemented a new API which has a little bit different format for the messages that come through the websocket and this in turn means some of the function calls and hooks have a different API.

We've implemented a new API with a slightly different message format delivered over the WebSocket. As a result, several function calls and hooks now have an updated interface.

### Message Interface

The message format has **changed**, so if you rely on any of the following you will need to update your code:

> Note we are **utilizing** our new [Elemental](https://www.courier.com/docs/elemental/elements/) standard:

```ts
interface OldMessage {
  title: string;
  body: string;
  blocks: Array<TextBlock | ActionBlock>;
}

interface NewMessage {
  title: string;
  preview: string;
  actions: Array<ActionElement>;
}
```

The new toast component also does _not_ show any buttons. The actual toast is clickable and will highlight a background color to let users know it has a link associated with it.

### [2.X]

You can revert and use the 2.X releases to prevent having the above breaking changes. You will need both `@trycourier/react-toast` and `@trycourier/react-provider` to be on the same 2.X version.

### [Theme](#theme)

- theme.message.actionBlock -> deprecated
  - the entire message is now clickable
- theme.message.textBlock -> theme.message.textElement
- `theme.message.clickableContainer`: when a message has an `action.href`, the entire message becomes clickable instead of rendering an explicit button. This theme property allows you to style that anchor element directly. `theme.message.container` will still apply to the component, but if you want to target the clickable container **separately** you can use `theme.message.clickableContainer`, which will be an `<a>` element rather than a `<div>`.
