## [What is Toast?](#what-is-toast)

Toast aims to be the easiest way to create in-app notifications. With a simple integration and straight forward API we make it easy for anyone to integrate fast.

Toast is a buzz word for a notification that happens in-app and slides in or pops up. The appearance is usually that of a rectangle in the top right of an application.

## [How does it work?](#how-does-it-work)

There are two ways to use this library:

1. With Courier as a transport provider
2. A standalone toast interface

You can use the [Courier Push integration](https://app.courier.com/integrations/courier) to create a notification through the designer and send a notification to a specific channel/event from an API request. This will trigger the toast to show wherever the client is running and listening for that same channel/event.

A channel/event combination is simply a stream on which a particular client is listening for toast notifications. A client must be subscribed to a channel and event in order to receive a notification.

## [3.X Breaking Changes](#3x-breaking-changes)

We've implemented a new API which has a little bit different format for the messages that come through the websocket and this in turn means some of the function calls and hooks have a different API.

### Message Interface

The format of the message has changd, so if you have any code that utilizes any of the following you will need to update:

1. Interacting with `useToast`
2. Intercepting messages with Courier Provider prop onMessage
3. Implemented `renderMessage` or `renderAction`

This is a contrived example of the changes:

> Note we are utilized our new [elemental](https://www.courier.com/docs/elemental/elements/) standard:

```ts
interface OldMessage {
  title: string;
  body: string;
  blocks: Array<TextBlock | ActionBlock>;
}

interface NewMessage {
  title: string;
  preview: string;
  actions: Array<ActionElement>;
}
```

The new toast component also does _not_ show any buttons. The actual toast is clickable and will highlight a background color to let users know it has a link associated with it.

### [2.X]

You can revert and use the 2.X releases to prevent having the above breaking changes. You will need both `@trycourier/react-toast` and `@trycourier/react-provider` to be on the same 2.X version.
